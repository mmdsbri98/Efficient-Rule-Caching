# Efficient-Rule-Caching
In this project, we implement a method for optimizing the management of switch capacity in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) through efficient collaborative rule caching, specifically exploring the pairing of P4 switches to enhance performance. This repository includes two main components:

Emulation: A setup for testing and demonstrating our approach on a small scale.
Simulation: A framework for evaluating the performance and scalability of our solution on a larger scale.
Our primary focus here is on the implementation details. For a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical foundations and in-depth analysis, please refer to our published paper, which provides detailed explanations and insights into our work.
